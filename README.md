Project Description:
This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to detect Tomato Bacterial Spot, a destructive disease that affects tomato plant leaves and reduces crop yield. The goal is to build an automated classification system that can accurately distinguish between Healthy tomato leaves and those infected with Bacterial Spot based on image analysis.

A MobileNetV2 model with transfer learning is used to perform the classification. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture, making it suitable for practical deployment and real-time disease detection scenarios. The model is trained on a dataset of tomato leaf images that includes thousands of labeled samples, organized into two classes and divided into training and validation sets.

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can support modern agriculture by enabling fast, scalable, and reliable disease detection. By automating the identification process, the system can help farmers and agricultural specialists monitor crop health more effectively, reduce losses, and promote smarter farming practices.
